### Chapter 1

# TESLA

Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.), is an American automotive and energy company based in Palo Alto, California.[8] The company specializes in electric car manufacturing and, through its SolarCity subsidiary, solar panel manufacturing.[9] It operates multiple production and assembly plants, such as Gigafactory 1 near Reno, Nevada, and its main vehicle manufacturing facility at Tesla Factory in Fremont, California.
Tesla was founded in July 2003, by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, under the name of Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to engineer Nikola Tesla. In early Series A funding, Tesla Motors was joined by Elon Musk, J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright, all of whom are retroactively allowed to call themselves co-founders of the company. Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the current chief executive officer, said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a technology company and independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer. Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla in February 2017.
